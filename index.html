					<p>
						I'm a full stack web developer and mobile app developer who strives to create
						simple yet robust solutions to interesting problems. I'm a firm believer in
						using the right tool for the right job, and as a result, I am comfortable with
						a wide variety of technologies.

					<h2>Software Developer</h2>
					<h3><a href="https://tactica.ca" target="_blank">Tactica Interactive</a></h3>
					<h4>May 2013 - Present</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-two-thirds">
					<p>
						Full-stack web development with Wordpress and Ruby On Rails;
						Mobile app development using Meteor.js and the React framework;
						occasional system administration on Linux servers; general problem
						solving and a frequent second set of eyes for other developers.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Tactica, I'm proud to say that I'm used to seeing sites and apps
						I've worked on advertised on billboards, buses, radio ads, newspaper
						articles and sometimes even movie theatre screens across Winnipeg, Manitoba.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some recent examples of these are the <a href="http://kidneyfailurerisk.com/"
						target="_blank">Kidney Failure Risk Equation</a> web app, and the My Autism
						Passport app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/my-autism-passport/id1272321231?mt=8"
						target="_blank">iOS</a> and

					<h3>Thorkelson Consulting</h3>
					<h4>January 2012 - April 2013</h4>

					<p>
						Using Ruby on Rails and some PHP, I helped develop and maintain
						<a href="http://canadadrugs.com/" target="_blank">Canada Drugs'</a> public-facing
						web application as well as writing middleware to interface
						with back-end enterprise software.
					</p>
					<p>
						All software built at Thorkelson Consulting was built using Behaviour
						and Test Driven Development, and I developed a strong sense of
						how to write quality code during my time there.

					I've been the lead vocalist and co-lead guitar player of this band since

					but it's really often an excuse to rant about things (like most podcasts). It used to be a
					terrestrial radio show before the station shut down!
